# RPrototyper

*version: 0.1*

A standalone project which uses Raylib to allow the user to create a 3D prototype using preexisting 3D objects and textures and import/export as json.

It includes Raygui.h for the UI and https://github.com/nlohmann/json for the import/export.

To use it, add some 3D objects and textures to the resources/ folder

Not yet in version 1.0, so the minimal version is not ready.
TODO:
- Import/export functionality
- Fixings
